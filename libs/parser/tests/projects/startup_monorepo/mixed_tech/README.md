# Mixed Technology Monorepo Scenario

This scenario represents a modern startup with multiple technology stacks:
- Express.js backend (backend/)
- Next.js frontend (frontend/) 
- FastAPI ML service (services/ml/)
- Flask auth service (services/auth/)

This tests multi-framework, multi-language detection across a single repository.
