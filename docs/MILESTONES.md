## Development Principles

### For AI Agents

1. **Clear Interfaces** - Each library has a defined public API
2. **Comprehensive Tests** - Every feature has unit and integration tests
3. **Type Safety** - Use Rust's type system and TypeScript
4. **Documentation** - Every public function has doc comments

### NX Commands for Each Phase

```bash
# Phase 1: Test the foundation
nx test core
nx test parser

# Phase 2: Test language support
nx test parser --grep="Python"
nx test parser --grep="Go"

# Phase 3: Develop desktop app
nx serve desktop
nx test desktop

# Phase 4: Test git integration
nx test git
nx run-many --target=test --projects=core,git

# Phase 5: Test AI features
nx test ai
nx run desktop:test:e2e

# Phase 6: Build for distribution
nx build-all
nx run desktop:package
```

## Metrics for Success

- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime during development
- **Developer Experience**: Set up new language support in < 1 hour

📋 Found 6 endpoint(s):
METHOD   PATH           HANDLER    LINE
Get      /users         5:5        5
Post     /users         9:5        9

# Real-time watching  
./target/release/apirena watch test-watch
📄 Created: test.js
📍 Found 1 endpoint(s): Get /test (line 1)
```

🎯 **Phase 2 Ready to Start**: Multi-language expansion + Test Architecture Complete
